# Movies Knowledge Graph with Neo4j, GROQ, and Llama3.1

This project builds a knowledge graph about movies using Neo4j, a powerful graph database. The knowledge graph is populated with data from a movie dataset, allowing users to ask complex questions about movies and receive refined, human-like responses through the integration of Llama-3.1-70b-Versatile, a large language model (LLM).

## Technologies Used

*   **Neo4j:** Graph database for storing and querying relationships between entities.
*   **Cypher Query Language (CQL):** Language for creating, manipulating, and querying data in Neo4j.
*   **GraphCypherQAChain:** Python library facilitating conversion of natural language questions into CQL queries.
*   **GROQ:** Python library for interacting with the Llama-3.1-70b-Versatile LLM model.
*   **Llama-3.1-70b-Versatile:** Large language model for refining extracted information and providing human-like responses.
